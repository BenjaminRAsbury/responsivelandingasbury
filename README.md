A simple, mobile-friendly landing page created with pure HTML and CSS.  The engaging layout seamlessly transitions between desktop and mobile display widths.

The original code was not... good.  I have updated the project with SASS, and it now functions as described.  This update has been a lesson in not making assumptions about how previous versions were constructed.  It also gave me invaluable experience in making changes to previously written code.  I could also make the argument that the code was originally written by effectively a different person.  My original showcased some shocking lapses in judgement.  Ever forward.
